# ESP32 Examples

This repository contains a collection of basic to intermediate examples for working with the ESP32 microcontroller. It includes code for interfacing various sensors, displays, and peripherals. Each example is designed to demonstrate a specific functionality, such as reading sensor data, controlling LEDs, working with I2C devices, and handling interrupts.

## Examples Included:
- 16x2 LCD with I2C
- 7-Segment Display Control
- ADXL335 Sensor Reading
- BME280 with I2C
- DAC (Digital-to-Analog Conversion)
- Touch Sensor Read and Interrupts

Feel free to explore and use these examples in your own ESP32 projects.
